    <h1>How To Play Mancala</h1>
</head>
<body>
    <p>Mancala is a traditional game that is played all over the world</p>
<ul><h2> Step 1: Vocabulary and Set Up</h2>
    <div><h4>You will see two rows of six "pits", with a long "mancala" on each end.
        <br> The board is divided into two parts: Your side and mancala, and your opponent's side and mancala.
        <br> Your side is the six pits closest to you, and your mancala is to your right. 
        <br>The same is for your opponent; their side is the six pits closest to them and their mancala is to their right.
    </h4></div>
<div>
    <h4>There are four "stones" in each pit, excluding the mancalas. This should total 48 stones.</h4>
</div>
<h2 style=>Step 2: Basic Gameplay</h2>
<h4 style=>
   <strong> Mancala is really an easy game to play!!</strong>
   During a turn, a player grabs all of the stones in a pit on their side and drops them,<br>
    one by one, in succeeding holes in a counter-clockwise direction.<br>
     Players MAY place stones in their own mancala (it counts as a pit), <br>
     but they MUST skip over their opponent's mancala.<br>
      Players MAY place stones in pits on their opponent's side. <br>
      This continues until the player has no more stones in his hand.<br>
       It is then their opponents turn.*
</h4>
<h2>
    Step 3: Scoring and Winning
</h2>
<h4>
    The game is over when a player (not both) has no more stones on his side. <br>
    His opponent then takes all of the stones on his side and places them in his mancala. <br>
    The winner is the person with the most stones in his mancala after counting.

</h4>
<h2>
    Step 4: Exceptions
</h2>
<h4>
    If, when dropping stones in pits, you drop a stone into your own mancala,<br>
     and that is the last stone in your hand, then you get to go again.<br>
If, when dropping stones into pits, you drop a stone into a pit that was previously empty, <br>
AND the pit is on your side, AND that was the last stone in your hand, <br>
you take all of the stones in the pit directly above, and place them into your mancala.
