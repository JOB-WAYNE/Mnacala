            Mancala is a traditional game that is played all over the world across various cultures, 
            especially in Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. The word "Mancala" itself is 
            derived from the Arabic word naqala, meaning "to move," which reflects the game's 
            primary mechanic of moving pieces around a board.

            You will see two rows of six (pits), with a long (mancala) on each end.
            <br>The board is divided into two parts: Your side and mancala, and your opponent's side and mancala.
            <br>Your side is the six pits closest to you, and your mancala is to your right. 
            <br>The same is for your opponent; their side is the six pits closest to them and their mancala is to their right.

        <p class="myParagraph">
            <strong>Mancala is a really easy game to play!!</strong>
            During a turn, a player grabs all of the stones <br> in a pit on their side and drops them,
            one by one, in succeeding (subsequent) <br>holes in a counter-clockwise direction.
            Players MAY place stones <br>in their own mancala (it counts as a pit),
            but they MUST skip over their opponent's mancala.<br>
            Players MAY place stones in pits on their opponent's side.<br>
            This continues until the player has no more stones in his hand.<br>
            It is then their opponents turn.*

    <div class="myParagraphWrapper">
        <p class="myParagraph">
            The game is over when a player (not both) has no more stones on his side.<br>
            His opponent then takes all of the stones on his side and places them in his mancala.<br>
            The winner is the person with the most stones in his mancala after counting.

            If, when dropping stones in pits, you drop a stone into your own mancala,<br>
            and that is the last stone in your hand, then you get to go again.<br>
            If, when dropping stones into pits, you drop a stone into a pit that was previously empty,<br>
            and the pit is on your side, AND that was the last stone in your hand,<br>
            you take all of the stones in the pit directly above, and place them into your mancala.
