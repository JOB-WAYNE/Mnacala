        <p>Vocabulary and Set Up</p>
    </div>
    <div class="myParagraphWrapper">
        <p class="myParagraph">
            You will see two rows of six (pits), with a long (mancala) on each end.
            <br>The board is divided into two parts: Your side and mancala, and your opponent's side and mancala.
            <br>Your side is the six pits closest to you, and your mancala is to your right. 
            <br>The same is for your opponent; their side is the six pits closest to them and their mancala is to their right.

        <p>Basic Gameplay</p>
    </div>
    <div class="myParagraphWrapper">
        <p class="myParagraph">
            <strong>Mancala is a really easy game to play!!</strong>
            During a turn, a player grabs all of the stones <br> in a pit on their side and drops them,
            one by one, in succeeding (subsequent) <br>holes in a counter-clockwise direction.
            Players MAY place stones <br>in their own mancala (it counts as a pit),
            but they MUST skip over their opponent's mancala.<br>
            Players MAY place stones in pits on their opponent's side.<br>
            This continues until the player has no more stones in his hand.<br>
            It is then their opponent's turn.*

        <p>Scoring and Winning</p>
    </div>
    <div class="myParagraphWrapper">
        <p class="myParagraph">
            The game is over when a player (not both) has no more stones on his side.<br>
            His opponent then takes all of the stones on his side and places them in his mancala.<br>
            The winner is the person with the most stones in his mancala after counting.

        <p>Exceptions</p>
    </div>
    <div class="myParagraphWrapper">
        <p class="myParagraph"> 
            If, when dropping stones in pits, you drop a stone into your own mancala,<br>
            and that is the last stone in your hand, then you get to go again.<br>
            If, when dropping stones into pits, you drop a stone into a pit that was previously empty,<br>
            and the pit is on your side, AND that was the last stone in your hand,<br>
            you take all of the stones in the pit directly above, and place them into your mancala.
